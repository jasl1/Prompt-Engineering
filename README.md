# Prompt-Engineering

 Here are some practical Python coding examples for different prompt engineering techniques and building a useful LLM application using prompt engineering:
 
###1. Few-shot Prompt Engineering
Few-shot prompting involves providing the language model with a few examples of the task you want it to perform, along with the expected output. This helps the model understand the task better and generate more accurate responses.

###2.) One-shot Prompt Engineering
One-shot prompting involves providing a single example of the task you want the language model to perform. This can be useful when you have limited examples or when you want to test the model's ability to generalize from a single example.
