# Prompt-Engineering

 Here are some practical Python coding examples for different prompt engineering techniques and building a useful LLM application using prompt engineering:
 
### 1. Few-shot Prompt Engineering
Few-shot prompting involves providing the language model with a few examples of the task you want it to perform, along with the expected output. This helps the model understand the task better and generate more accurate responses.

### 2.) One-shot Prompt Engineering
One-shot prompting involves providing a single example of the task you want the language model to perform. This can be useful when you have limited examples or when you want to test the model's ability to generalize from a single example.

### 3.) Zero-shot Prompt Engineering
Zero-shot prompting involves providing the language model with a task description without any examples. This tests the model's ability to understand and perform the task based solely on the description.

### 4.) Chain-of-Thought Prompt Engineering
Chain-of-thought prompting involves asking the language model to break down a complex task into smaller steps and provide its thought process or reasoning. This can help the model generate more coherent and accurate responses, especially for tasks that require multi-step reasoning.

### 5.) Building a Useful LLM Application Using Prompt Engineering
Here's an example of building a simple question-answering application using prompt engineering with the GPT-3 model:

```python
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Define the prompt with a few examples
prompt = """
You are an AI assistant that can answer questions based on the provided context. Here are some examples:

Context: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Question: What color is the fox?
Answer: The fox is brown.

Context: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'
Question: Who was Alice sitting with?
Answer: Alice was sitting with her sister.

Context: In the United States, the president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is elected to a four-year term by the people through an Electoral College. The president is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the federal agencies, including the Cabinet.
Question: What is the role of the president in the United States?
Answer:

Context: [CONTEXT]
Question: [QUESTION]
Answer:
"""

# Get the context and question from the user
context = input("Enter the context: ")
question = input("Enter your question: ")

# Construct the final prompt with the user input
final_prompt = prompt.replace("[CONTEXT]", context).replace("[QUESTION]", question)

# Generate the answer using the GPT-3 model
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=final_prompt,
    max_tokens=100,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Print the generated answer
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())

```

In this example, the application prompts the user to enter a context and a question. It then constructs a prompt that includes the user input, along with a few examples of question-answering tasks. The prompt is then sent to the GPT-3 model, which generates an answer based on the provided context and question.
These examples demonstrate various prompt engineering techniques and how they can be applied to build useful LLM applications. Prompt engineering is an iterative process, and you may need to experiment with different prompts and techniques to achieve the desired results for your specific use case.
